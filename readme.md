# Rendering in rust

This is a (not finished) ray tracer written in rust.
It is based on the book serie [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) and [Physics Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/).

This rust version is my third implementation, the previous being:


- [Raytracing in c](https://git.jtle.dk/raytrace/about/)
    This is the one which gives the best results,
    however as my ambitions for the project grew as did my requirement for more language features.
- [Pathtracing in c++](https://github.com/jbjjbjjbj/rendering/tree/old_master)
I never really finished it before changing to rust.
    However it had a really cool qt gui, updating as samples were added.
